// Explanation
// a line at which a debugger halts a program so its state can be inspected
// a breakpoint triggered by a certain condition, such as a value reaching 100. Also known as a watchpoint
// a tool that offers debugging facilities such as running code line by line to inspect internal variable states
// a reported bug that has already been reported—perhaps in a different way
// as in the claim: “it’s not a bug, it’s a feature”. You’ll find yourself saying this at some point
// how often a bug occurs
// the most-often made but least useful bug report
// a debugger instruction that shows the value of an expression during execution
// output of runtime information to the console or a file
// the program works but doesn’t act as intended
// where a bug is allocated on a list of planned updates
// hard-to-trace bugs dependent the sequence or timing of uncontrollable events
// rewriting code to help readability and maintenance
// re-emergence of a previously fixed bug perhaps owing to other updates
// a bug that’s similar or related to another the steps required to cause the error
// user incompetence disguised as a bug report, typically followed by a developer’s response that they should “Read

// when running code line by line in a debugger, step into the

// when running line by line, complete execution of the current function and return to the calling code
// when running line by line, complete execution of a command without stepping into a function it calls
// the impact of a bug on system. For example, data loss would normally be considered more problematic than a one-pixel UI alignment issue unless the frequency of occurrence is very low

// typographical errors, such as console.lug()
// an error caused by a user rather than the application. This may still incur an update, depending on the seniority of the person who caused it!
// a variable or expression output during debugger execution
